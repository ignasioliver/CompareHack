Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThese draft Regulations consolidate, with amendments, the Tryptophan in Food Regulations 1990, as amended. They\ncontinue to prohibit the addition of tryptophan to food, and the sale, offer for sale and exposure for sale of food\ncontaining tryptophan, subject to exemptions. \n\nThese draft Regulations allow the addition of a new exemption from the prohibitions of the original Regulations in\nrespect of L-tryptophan added to food supplements if certain conditions are met with regard to purity and recommended\ndaily dose. \n\nThe draft Regulations include the insertion of a qualification to the existing exemption in respect of L-tryptophan or its\nsalts added to foods for a particular nutritional use in that the added substance must comply with specific purity criteria. \n\nThe UK will fulfil it\u2019s obligation under article 12 of Directive 98/34/EC when these Regulations, and parallel Regulations\nto be made in England, Scotland and Wales, are officially published. \n\nKeywords: Tryptophan, food supplements, PARNUTS. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThe Committee for the Toxicology of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) recently\nconsidered up-to-date evidence on tryptophan and concluded that L-tryptophan as a dietary (food) supplement, would\nnot present an appreciable risk to health provided that it met the purity criteria specified in the European\nPharmacopoeia (EP) and that the maximum recommended intake for an adult was 220mg/day. \n\nGiven COT\u2019s conclusions, there is a case for introducing a requirement that where L-tryptophan (or any of its salts) is\nadded to infant formulas, follow-on formulas, processed cereal based baby foods and baby foods intended for infants\nand young children or other foods for particular nutritional uses, it should also, in these cases, comply with EP purity\ncriteria. \n\n10.

Products Concerned\nAlcohol products sold at retail level for human consumption. \n\n7. Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThe effect of the legislation is that an alcohol product must not be sold to consumers at a price below the minimum\nprice. The legislation prescribes a formula to calculate the minimum price of each product, which is MPU x S x V x 100;\nwhere MPU is the minimum price per unit (specified by order), S is the strength of the product (actual ABV or \u201cdeclared\u201d\nABV) and V is the volume of the product in litres (S x V x 100 calculates how many 10 millilitre units of pure alcohol the\nproduct contains). \n\nFor example, the minimum price of a 1 litre alcohol product of 5.5% ABV would be calculated as follows \u2013 \n\nMPU = \u00a30.50 \nS = 5.5% \nV = 1 \n\nMinimum price of the product = MPU x S x V x 100 \n\n= 0.5 x 5.5% x 1 x 100 \n\n= \u00a32.75 \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nMinimum pricing aims to reduce alcohol consumption across the Scottish population to improve public health and attain\nsocial benefits in the areas of crime, public services, productivity and the economy as a whole. In particular, it aims to\ntarget a reduction in consumption of cheaper alcohol products relative to their strength because the evidence shows\nthat this type of product is more likely to be favoured by hazardous and harmful drinkers, and they are likely to benefit\nmost from a reduction in alcohol-related harms. \n\nA summary of the policy and the evidence behind it can be found at the beginning of the accompanying Business and\nRegulatory Impact Assessment. \n\nMinimum pricing is a key part of a wider strategy. The Scottish Government\u2019s alcohol strategy (\u201cChanging Scotland\u2019s\nRelationship with Alcohol: A Framework for Action\u201d, published in 2009) sets out over 40 measures aimed at addressing\nalcohol-related harm and is closely aligned with the World Health Organisation\u2019s Global strategy to reduce harmful use\nof alcohol. \n\nPage 3 of 8\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThese draft Regulations consolidate, with amendments, the Tryptophan in Food Regulations 1990, as amended, in\nrelation to England. They continue to prohibit the addition of tryptophan to food, and the sale, offer for sale and\nexposure for sale of food containing tryptophan, subject to exemptions. \n\nThese draft Regulations allow the addition of a new exemption from the prohibitions of the original Regulations in\nrespect of L-tryptophan added to food supplements if certain conditions are met with regard to purity and recommended\ndaily dose. \n\nThe draft Regulations include the insertion of a qualification to the existing exemption in respect of L-tryptophan or its\nsalts added to foods for a particular nutritional use in that the added substance must comply with specific purity criteria. \n\nThe UK will fulfil it\u2019s obligation under article 12 of Directive 98/34/EC when these Regulations, and parallel Regulations\nto be made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are officially published. \n\nKeywords: Tryptophan, food supplements, PARNUTS. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThe Committee for the Toxicology of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) recently\nconsidered up-to-date evidence on tryptophan and concluded that L-tryptophan as a dietary (food) supplement, would\nnot present an appreciable risk to health provided that it met the purity criteria specified in the European\nPharmacopoeia (EP) and that the maximum recommended intake for an adult was 220mg/day. \n\nGiven COT\u2019s conclusions, there is a case for introducing a requirement that where L-tryptophan (or any of its salts) is\nadded to infant formulas, follow-on formulas, processed cereal based baby foods and baby foods intended for infants\nand young children or other foods for particular nutritional uses, it should also, in these cases, comply with EP purity\ncriteria. \n\n10.

Products Concerned\nClause 8 of the Data Protection Bill provides that where consent is the lawful ground for processing data relating to the offer of\ninformation society services, children under 13 years old require parental consent or authority to consent. \n\nThe scope of the provision is limited to consent relating to the offer of information society services only. \n\n7. Notification Under Another Act\n- Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market \n- 98/48/EC information society services only \n\n8. Main Content\nArticle 8 GDPR sets out the conditions applicable to a child\u2019s consent in relation to the offer of \u2018information society services\u2019 directly\nto a child. \n\nArticle 8(1) states that where Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (that processing shall be lawful only if the data subject has given consent to the\nprocessing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes) applies - in relation to the offer of information society\nservices directly to a child - the processing shall only be lawful where that child is at least 16 years old. \n\nWhere a child is under 16, processing will only be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of\nparental responsibility over the child. \n\nArticle 8(1) permits derogation from this rule and states: \n\nMember States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. \n\nThe UK therefore has the option of setting the age at which a child may consent to the processing of their personal data by those\noffering information society services, to an age between 13 and 16. \n\nClause 8 of the Data Protection Bill gives effect to this derogation and sets the age threshold below which parental consent is\nrequired at 13 years old. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThe GDPR is a directly acting European Regulation and will come into force in the UK from 25 May 2018. Whilst EU Regulations do\nnot normally require implementation, a Data Protection Bill is being prepared in order to achieve a number of aims including the\nimplementation of derogations and options offered under the GDPR. \n\nThe UK has chosen to set the age at which a child can consent to the processing of data for the purposes of the provision of\ninformation society services at 13 years old under clause 8 of the Data Protection Bill. This is in line with the age of consent already\nset as a matter of contract by some of the most popular information society services which currently offer services to and are\naccessed by children (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Instagram). \n\nIn relation to the offer of preventative or counselling services to a child of any age, the policy position is that consent from a person\nwith parental control should not be required which is in line with recital 38 GDPR (which states that the consent of the holder of\nparental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventative and counselling services offered directly to a child). \n\nThis would minimise the burden placed on those with parental responsibility to provide consent. In addition, children aged 13 and\nabove would not need to seek consent from a guardian when accessing, for example, information society services which provide\neducational websites and research resources to complete their homework. \n\nThe overall policy aim is to exercise the Article 8 GDPR derogation so that parental consent is required only up to the minimum age\n\nPage 3 of 8\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n\n\n5.

Main Content\nThe Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) scheme is designed to incentivise the generation of renewable electricity in Great Britain,\ntaking into account the financial and non-financial barriers present, through paying generation and export tariffs for\nthe electricity generated. The scheme ensures that solar photovoltaic and wind turbine installations of up to 50kW in\ndeclared net capacity and micro-combined heat and power installations of up to 2kW in declared net capacity are of\nsuitable quality and value for money through setting a certification criterion (see section 9 below for details). The costs\nof the FIT scheme are spread across the Great British electricity supply market by a levelisation process and so are\nborne by consumers in their energy bills. \n\nKeywords: renewable electricity; technology; product; solar photovoltaic; wind turbine; combined heat and power;\ninstallation; Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS). \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nAssured installation of renewable electricity generating equipment. \nAn eligibility criterion of the Feed-in Tariff scheme is that plant must be certified under either: \n- The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) and installed in accordance with the relevant installation standard;\nor \n- A scheme where: \ni) installers are certified to that scheme\u2019s standards by an organisation accredited to EN 45011 or EN ISO/IE\n17065:2012; \nii) the plant is installed in accordance with the installation standards applicable the plant under that scheme on the\nplant\u2019s first commissioning date and which are equivalent to a relevant installation standard; and \niii) that scheme is equivalent to the MCS. \n\nThis Order updates three of the installation standards notified in The Feed-in Tariffs (Amendment) (No 3) Order 2015\n(ref 2016/0022/UK).

Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThe consultation package contains the following sections: \nSection 1 - the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment giving an assessment of the impact, benefits and costs of the\nproposals in the light of the UK policies on climate change and energy efficiency; \nSections 2 to 5 - drafts of proposed new Building Regulations Approved Documents that would, if implemented,\nsignificantly raise the energy performance standards that apply in England and Wales whenever building work is carried\nout to construct new buildings and alter or extend existing ones; \nSection 6 - Future Performance Standards giving forecasts of the performance standards that could be introduced in\nEngland and Wales in a further amendment around 2010; \nSection 7 - Proposals for Implementing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in England and Wales; \nSection 8 - Calculation Methodologies: a situation report on the development of the UK calculation methodology for\nbuildings that are not dwellings as required by Article 3 of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. The\nGovernment\u2019s Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings is being revised to take account of\nArticle 3 and the Annex to the Directive and the working draft of this has been published for comment at\nwww.bre.co.uk/sap2005; \nSection 9 - Adaptation Strategy: proposals for taking account of climate change in the future development of Building\nRegulations energy performance requirements, \nSection 10 - a Dissemination Strategy proposing ways to make people aware of the proposed changes, to help them\nunderstand the practical implications, and put them into practice. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nIn the Energy White Paper (EWP) the UK Government confirmed the need to counter the impacts of global warming and\nset out goals for cutting UK carbon dioxide emissions as its contribution to international mitigation efforts. The White\nPaper also addressed issues of fuel scarcity and energy infrastructure renewal in the UK. About half of all UK carbon\ndioxide emissions come from burning fossil fuels used to provide energy for buildings so building energy efficiency is\nseen as a key goal. The EWP signalled the aim of bringing the next revision of the energy efficiency provisions in the\nBuilding Regulations into effect in 2005. \nThe EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive obliges Member States to introduce requirements setting building\nenergy performance standards, making energy performance certificates available whenever buildings are constructed\nsold or rented out, and setting up regular energy performance inspections for boilers and air conditioning systems.\nMember States have to introduce the measures needed to comply with the Directive\u2019s requirements by 04 January\n2006. \n\nPage 3 of 10\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n\n\n2004/0303/UK \u2013 B00 \n\n5.

Products Concerned\nGaming machines \n\n7. Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThe Gambling Act 2005 (\u201cthe 2005 Act\u201d) will regulate the use of gaming machines in Great Britain from 1st\nSeptember 2007. The 2005 Act gives the Gambling Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), the responsibility to\nlicense operators that manufacture, supply, install, adapt, maintain or repair gaming machines in Great Britain.\nIt will be a condition of such gaming machine technical licences that the operator complies with the\nCommission\u2019s Gaming Machine Technical Standards, from 1st September 2007. The Standards set out in\ndetail the technical requirements relating to gaming machines and cover: \n\u2022 Hardware requirements (including security and identification of the machine); \n\u2022 Software requirements and Critical memory requirements; \n\u2022 Machine credit and payment requirements; \n\u2022 Game requirements (including the means of determining the outcome of a game, game cycle speed and game\nfeatures); \n\u2022 Metering, error and alert requirements; and \n\u2022 Display requirements. \n\nThe Standards vary according to the category of gaming machine (as defined in The Categories of Gaming\nMachine Regulations - see notification 2006/0565/UK), and the manner in which the machine operates and\nmakes allowances for machines currently in the market. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThe Standards are needed to ensure that the manner in which gaming machines operate meets the 2005 Act\nlicensing objectives i.e. to keep gambling crime-free, ensure gambling is fair and open and prevent harm from\ngambling. The Standards ensure that machine outcomes are determined fairly, that the customer is given\nsufficient information to make choices and that information can be retrieved from the machine to check\ncompliance or handle customer complaints and disputes. The Standards also ensure that game cycle speeds\nare limited and that the customer has the ability to control their own spend. The Standards draw upon existing\ninternational regulatory and industry best practice. The Standards permit equivalence between different types of\ntechnology and do not specify proprietary products or technologies. Testing regimes for these standards will\npermit equivalent international standards (ISO). These Standards complement the UK\u2019s Gaming Machine\n(Circumstances of Use) Regulations submitted under notification 2007/0236/UK. \n\n10.

In 2004, under the Building\nRegulations, we intend to introduce testing of the sound insulation of a sample of new dwellings as a check on\nperformance. This consultation is to collect views on accepting use of Robust Standard Details for the design of\nseparating walls and floors, as an alternative to testing. Robust Standard Details (RSDs) are high performance\nconstructions that should provide consistently good performance and be reasonably workmanship tolerant. \n\nKeywords: sound insulation, building regulations, separating walls, separating floors. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nTesting sound insulation is expensive and can cause delays in the sale of dwellings. The Robust Standard Detail\napproach should be as effective as testing but avoid causing delays. \n\n10. Reference Documents - Basic Texts\nIntroductory letter and the Robust Standard Details are forwarded with this notice.

Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThese draft Regulations consolidate, with amendments, the Tryptophan in Food Regulations 1990, as amended, in\nrelation to Scotland. They continue to prohibit the addition of tryptophan to food, and the sale, offer for sale and\nexposure for sale of food containing tryptophan, subject to exemptions. \n\nThese draft Regulations allow the addition of a new exemption from the prohibitions of the original Regulations in\nrespect of L-tryptophan added to food supplements if certain conditions are met with regard to purity and recommended\ndaily dose. \n\nThe draft Regulations include the insertion of a qualification to the existing exemption in respect of L-tryptophan or its\nsalts added to foods for a particular nutritional use in that the added substance must comply with specific purity criteria. \n\nThe UK will fulfil it\u2019s obligation under article 12 of Directive 98/43/EC when these Regulations, and parallel Regulations\nto be made in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are officially published \n\nKeywords: Tryptophan, food supplements, PARNUTS. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThe Committee for the Toxicology of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) recently\nconsidered up-to-date evidence on tryptophan and concluded that L-tryptophan as a dietary (food) supplement, would\nnot present an appreciable risk to health provided that it met the purity criteria specified in the European\nPharmacopoeia (EP) and that the maximum recommended intake for an adult was 220mg/day. \n\nGiven COT\u2019s conclusions, there is a case for introducing a requirement that where L-tryptophan (or any of its salts) is\nadded to infant formulas, follow-on formulas, processed cereal based baby foods and baby foods intended for infants\nand young children or other foods for particular nutritional uses, it should also, in these cases, comply with EP purity\ncriteria. \n\n10.

Title\nPhonepayPlus Code of Practice (14th Edition) \n\nPage 2 of 8\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n\n\n6. Products Concerned\nThe PhonepayPlus Code of Practice (14th Edition), which Ofcom is minded to approve under Section 121 of the Communications\nAct 2003, regulates the provision and contents of premium rate services (PRS) in the UK, and the facilities made available in the\nprovision of such services. \n\nPRS typically offer some form of content, product or service that is charged to users\u2019 phone bills. PhonepayPlus is the day-to-day\nregulator of PRS in the UK. \n\n7. Notification Under Another Act\n- On 27 March 2015, Ofcom notified the European Commission, BEREC and other Member States of its provisional decision to\napprove PhonepayPlus' thirteenth Code of Practice (the '13th Code') under Directive 98/34/EC. The TRIS reference number for\nthat notification is 2015/146/UK. No comments were received by Ofcom following the end of the three-month standstill period and,\nas a result, the 13th Code was approved by Ofcom and entered into force on 1 July 2015.\n\nSave in those respects highlighted at point 8 below, the 14th Code which is the subject of this notification is the same as the 13th\nCode. \n\n8. Main Content\nThe most significant changes in the 14th Code (as against the 13th Code) are in Part 4 which sets out the procedures to be\nfollowed, and PhonepayPlus' powers, in relation to investigations, procedures and sanctions. \n\nThe key changes highlighted in the Ofcom consultation are as follows: \n\ni) The inclusion of high-level criteria in the Code which will be used by PhonepayPlus to determine whether a case should be\nallocated to either a 'Track 1' or 'Track 2' investigation. \n\nii) A consideration of whether it would be appropriate to impose interim measures (i.e. a revenue withhold and/or service\nsuspension order) at an early stage in all 'Track 2' investigations which would result in the removal of the case allocation track\ncurrently known as the \u201cEmergency Procedure\u201d. \n\niii) The recommendations of the Investigations Team at various key stages of an investigation to be subject to oversight by senior\nmembers of PhonepayPlus. \n\niv) Replacement of the current Code Compliance Panel with a new body - the Code Adjudication Panel (CAP) - which, unlike the\nCCP, will not include members of the PhonepayPlus Board. A Tribunal with members drawn from the CAP will make any decision\nto impose interim measures or to ratify a settlement with a PRS operator. Further, any final breach finding and sanction decision\n(where the parties are unable to settle) will be made by a Tribunal. \n\nv) A formal \u201cWarning Notice\u201d to be issued to PRS operators setting out details of any alleged breaches, supporting evidence and\nany recommended sanctions before the case is presented to a Tribunal for decision. Under the 13th Code, PhonepayPlus does\nnot include details of any recommended sanctions under its alleged 'Breach Notice'. \n\nvi) A more flexible adjudication or review hearing, which allows for different levels of oral and legal representation. \n\nvii) Replacement of the current post-adjudication review stages and the Independent Appeals Body (IAB) with a single, limited\nreview procedure. \n\nThe 14th Code includes other, more minor consequential changes, and it should be noted that Ofcom's approval is in relation to\nthe entirety of the 14th Code (i.e. not just Part 4, which has been subject to the most change). \n\nHaving regard inter alia to the provisions of the 14th Code and subject to any comments received following this consultation,\nOfcom is minded to approve the 14th Code. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nPhonepayPlus regulates PRS via its Code of Practice, which is approved by Ofcom under section 121 of the Communications Act\n2003. Ofcom may only approve the Code where certain statutory requirements are met, including that (i) the Code\u2019s provisions\nare transparent, objectively justifiable, proportionate, and not unduly discriminatory, and (ii) it appears to Ofcom that it would be\nappropriate for it to approve the Code. \n\nPage 3 of 8\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n", "UK_2017_278.pdf": "Remote gambling and software technical standards ", "UK_1994_334.pdf": "mpt 1382 october 1994\nangle modulated 27 mhz radio equipment for use in the\ncitizen's band radio service.", "UK_1997_37.pdf": "The Food (Control of Irradiation) (Amendment) Regulations.\nThese proposals apply to the UK only.

They continue to prohibit the addition of tryptophan to food, and the sale, offer for sale and exposure\nfor sale of food containing tryptophan, subject to exemptions. \n\nThese draft Regulations allow the addition of a new exemption from the prohibitions of the original Regulations in\nrespect of L-tryptophan added to food supplements if certain conditions are met with regard to purity and recommended\ndaily dose. \n\nThe draft Regulations include the insertion of a qualification to the existing exemption in respect of L-tryptophan or its\nsalts added to foods for a particular nutritional use in that the added substance must comply with specific purity criteria. \n\nThe UK will fulfil its obligation under Article 12 of Directive 98/34/EC by including a reference to the Directive in the\nRegulations when they are officially published. Parallel Regulations are to be made in England, Scotland and Northern\nIreland and will be notified separately. \n\nKeywords: Tryptophan, food supplements, PARNUTS. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThe Committee for the Toxicology of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) recently\nconsidered up-to-date evidence on tryptophan and concluded that L-tryptophan as a dietary (food) supplement, would\nnot present an appreciable risk to health provided that it met the purity criteria specified in the European\nPharmacopoeia (EP) and that the maximum recommended intake for an adult was 220mg/day. \n\nGiven COT\u2019s conclusions, there is a case for introducing a requirement that where L-tryptophan (or any of its salts) is\nadded to infant formulas, follow-on formulas, processed cereal based baby foods and baby foods intended for infants\nand young children or other foods for particular nutritional uses, it should also, in these cases, comply with EP purity\ncriteria. \n\n10.

Main Content\nTo amend the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997 to include (a) a prohibition on the supply of air bombs to the general public; (b) tighten up (modify) the definition of \u201cmini rockets\u201d; and, (c) create a strict liability offence for suppliers selling\nfireworks to those under the age of 18. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nIn respect of: \n\n(a) Air bombs are responsible in the UK for a number of injuries caused by fireworks \u2013 and are the preferred firework for anti social elements. \n\n(b) The UK industry recognise that some importers and manufacturers may try to get round the current definition if mini rockets by manufacturing/ importing similar products. The smaller rockets not covered/ defined as mini rockets are\neither still unsafe by virtue of their sensitivity to wind or their attractiveness to irresponsible persons. \n\n(c) Fireworks are still being supplied to those under the age of 18 - and it is expected that by changing the law to scrap the \u201cdue diligence\u201d defence to that of \u201cstrict liability\u201d, retailers will adopt a more proactive approach to determine the\nage of prospective buyers i.e. ask for age verifying identification. \n\n10.
