Main Content\nArticle 41 of Act 2006-1772 of 30 December 2006 on water and aquatic environments (French abbreviation LEMA)\nintroduces an obligation for sprayers, sold new or second-hand by machinery professionals for use in French territory,\nto comply with provisions designed to reduce risks to the environment and public health. \nThe principles of the \u2018new approach\u2019 Community doctrine were used in drafting texts implementing this article: the draft\nDecree to which this notification relates provides for an order defining the requirements and creates a regulatory\nframework for it. It also provides for the publication, for information purposes, of references to standards, technical\nspecifications or manufacturing procedures underpinning the presumption of compliance with these requirements. The\nsaid order and notice are notified at the same time as the draft Decree. \nThese requirements do not cover operator safety, insofar as such requirements are already laid down in the\nEmployment Code, transposing Directive 98/37/EC relating to machinery. \nArticle 1 of the draft Decree introduces various articles in the Rural Code. These articles cover the definition of various\nterms used to set rules relating to sprayers, followed by requirements applicable to sprayers sold new, requirements\napplicable to second-hand sprayers, and miscellaneous provisions (penalties and orders to be issued in implementation\nof the Decree): \n\nDefinitions \nArticle D. 526-1 defines the term \u2018sprayer\u2019 based on the concept of machinery taken from the Machinery Directive\n(concept defined in Article R. 233-83 and R. 233-83-1 of the Employment Code, transposing Article 1 of Directive\n98/37/EC relating to machinery). It distinguishes between \u2018new sprayers\u2019, for which the applicable requirements may be\ntaken into account at the design stage, and \u2018second-hand sprayers\u2019, for which the applicable requirements must be\ndefined in consideration of the possibilities for repairs. This distinction is similar to that made for machinery in Article R.\n233-49-3 of the Employment Code. \nIt also defines the term \u2018machinery professional\u2019, the person responsible for compliance when selling a sprayer, which is\ndesigned to encompass manufacturers and importers of sprayers as well as retailers of agricultural machinery.\nProfessional users of sprayers such as farmers, cooperatives for the use of agricultural equipment or service providers\nfor the application of phytosanitary products are not affected, insofar as they do not have competence to ensure the\n\nPage 3 of 18\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n\n\nDirection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la For\u00eat et des Affaires Rurales /Sous-Direction de l\u2019Environnement et de la Ruralit\u00e9 / Bureau\ndes Sols et de l\u2019Eau \n78, rue de Varenne \n75 349 PARIS 07 SP \nkristell.cohu@agriculture.gouv.fr \ntel : 01 49 55 59 27 \u2013 fax : 01 49 55 59 87 \n\n4.

Products Concerned\nCivilian unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) \n\n7. Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nDue to the increase in the number of unlawful flights over sensitive French sites by drones since autumn 2014, two members of the\nFrench Parliament tabled a draft law in spring 2016 on improving safety measures when using civilian drones. This draft was the\nresult of the Government report to Parliament entitled \u2018The rise in civilian aerial drones in France: challenges and possible responses\nfrom the State\u2019, published in October 2015. \nThe law was finally adopted by the French Parliament and enacted on 24 October 2016 (Law No 2016-1428). It imposes new\nobligations on pilots, owners or manufacturers of civilian unmanned aerial vehicles. These are intended to prevent incidents posing a\nrisk to State security, and make pilots accountable. \nThe Draft Order notified by France to the Member States and European Commission under Directive (EU) 2015/1535 aims to define\nthe contents of the user manual to be provided with unmanned aerial vehicles and their main spare parts, pursuant to Article L425-1\nof the Consumer Code. The manual shall include the same amount of information as the manual placed online by the French\nDirectorate-General for Civil Aviation for recreational drones (see\nhttps://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/R%C3%A8gles%20d%27usage%20d%27un%20drone%20de%20loisir.pdf);\nusing the manual published by the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) is an acceptable means of compliance with the\nrequirement. \n\n9. Brief Statement of Grounds\nThis Draft Order therefore aims to supplement, for reasons of guaranteeing public safety and State security, the French regulatory\nframework relating to unmanned aerial vehicles established by the Order of 17 December 2015 relating to the design of civilian\nunmanned aerial vehicles, the conditions for their use and the skills required of those using them and the Order of 17 December\n2015 as amended on 30 March 2017 on the use of airspace by unmanned aerial vehicles. \nThe requirements contained in this Draft Order aim to define the contents of the user manual which shall accompany unmanned\naerial vehicles and their main spare parts. \nThe aim is to ensure that purchasers of drones (new or second-hand) receive a minimum amount of information on the regulations\nconcerning drones so that they act in a safe and respectful manner. The recommendations in the aforementioned report which have\nbeen included in the law are based on, in particular, the belief that greater compliance with the regulations by well-meaning users will\ngreatly decrease the number of false alarms and also facilitate the work of the services responsible for the prevention of attacks to\nthe security and protection of sensitive sites. \n\n10.

Products Concerned\nProduct codes concerned: B10, B30. \n\n7. Notification Under Another Act\n- \n\n8. Main Content\nThe Water Act of 30 December 2006 significantly amended the existing regulatory framework. \nFurthermore, Article R. 2224-17 of the French Local Authorities Code lays down that the technical specifications applicable to individual sewerage systems receiving a gross load of organic waste less than or equal\nto 1.2 kg of BOD5 shall be laid down by joint order of the Ministers responsible for Health, Housing and the Environment. \nMoreover, Article L. 1331-1-1 of the Public Health Code lays down that the maintenance methods for individual sewerage systems shall be defined by order of the Ministers responsible for Health, the Environment\nand Housing. \n\nThe notified draft text follows on from these provisions and is intended to revise the Order of 6 May 1996 laying down the technical specifications applicable to individual sewerage systems. \n\nDuring the drafting of this text, the principles of the \u201cnew approach\u201d Community doctrine were applied: the notified draft Order provides for compliance with the essential requirements of the construction products\ndirective and the technical specifications of the reference documents which are the standards. It allows the publication of these reference documents, the list of bodies appointed to perform the technical\nassessment, the technical assessment protocol, the procedure for requesting an assessment, the list of approved systems and the corresponding technical data sheets. \nThis draft text is divided into 5 sections which define the general principles; the minimum technical specifications applicable to treatment; the minimum technical specifications applicable to drainage; maintenance\nand disposal of individual sewerage by-products and sewage and the specific cases of dry toilets. The annex to the text lays down the list of systems approved by the co-signatory ministers. \n\nThis draft does not affect existing technical specifications and reaffirms the purifying capacity of soil and other validated materials. However, it amends the authorisation procedure for innovative processes, which\nwere previously validated by the French Higher Public Health Council. \nThe draft text provides for the drafting of a protocol which, in particular, makes it possible to show that the conditions of installation of these treatment systems, as specified by the manufacturer, make it possible to\nguarantee that the systems into which they are integrated comply with: \n- the minimum requirements described in the draft Order, \n- as well as the following maximum concentrations after treatment: 30 mg/l in suspended solids (SS) and 35 mg/l for BOD5. \n\nPage 1 of 10\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nGROWTH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL \n \nSingle Market for goods\nPrevention of Technical Barriers\n\n \n\n\n\nNotification Number: 2008/333/F\n\nOrder laying down the technical requirements applicable to individual sewerage systems receiving a gross load of\norganic waste less than or equal to 1.2 kg/day of BOD5 \n\nMessage\n\nMessage 002 \n\nCommunication from the Commission - SG(2008) D/51484 \nDirective 98/34/EC \nTranslation of the message 001 \nNotification: 2008/0333/F \n\nNo abre el plazo - Nezahajuje odklady - Fristerne indledes ikke - Kein Fristbeginn - Viivituste perioodi ei avata - \u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03be\u03b7 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 - Does not open the delays - N'ouvre pas de d\u00e9lais - Non fa decorrere la\nmora - Neietekm\u0113 atlik\u0161anu - Atid\u0117jimai nepradedami - Nem nyitja meg a k\u00e9s\u00e9seket - Ma\u2019 jifta\u0127x il-perijodi ta\u2019 dawmien - Geen termijnbegin - Nie otwiera op\u00f3\u017anie\u0144 - Nao inicia o prazo - Neotvor\u00ed oneskorenia - Ne\nuvaja zamud - M\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4aika ei ala t\u00e4st\u00e4 - Inleder ingen frist - \u041d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u044a\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 - Nu deschide perioadele de stagnare - Nu deschide perioadele de stagnare. \n\n(MSG: 200801484.EN) \n\n1.
